# Feature Intake

Every implementation prompt enters the intake gate before code changes. A new
project spec or existing-project onboarding request also enters through this
gate before it becomes product docs, stories, validation expectations, or
implementation work.

The human does not need to classify risk. The harness does.

## Intake Flow

## Input Types

Use the input type to decide where the work should land before choosing the risk
lane.

| Type | Use when | Typical artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New spec | Turning a user-provided project spec into harness-ready docs | Product docs, candidate epics, decisions |
| Existing project onboarding | Installing Project Harness into a repo that already has code, docs, tests, or unclear implementation state | Baseline audit, current-state docs, architecture overview, validation matrix, inferred backlog |
| Spec slice | Implementing selected behavior from an accepted spec | Story packet |
| Change request | Changing, fixing, or refining accepted behavior | Story packet or direct patch |
| New initiative | Adding a larger product area that needs multiple stories | Initiative notes plus story packets |
| Maintenance request | Changing technical, operational, or dependency behavior | Story packet, validation report, or decision |
| Harness improvement | Improving how humans and agents collaborate | Direct docs update or `scripts/bin/harness-cli backlog add` |

Do not create or extend a monolithic spec by default after intake. Use product
docs, stories, decisions, and initiative notes as the living surface.

When onboarding an existing project, do not treat empty or generated docs as
truth. Follow `docs/harness/ONBOARDING_EXISTING_PROJECT.md` and label findings
as `confirmed`, `partial`, `unknown`, or `not implemented`.

## Template Usage

When work creates, normalizes, or syncs documentation:

1. Read `docs/harness/TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.md`.
2. Select the registered template for each document type.
3. Create only documents justified by a spec, existing code, existing docs,
   explicit human request, or the onboarding workflow.
4. Do not create placeholder product domains just to fill the structure.
5. Mark assumptions, conflicts, and open questions clearly.
6. During existing-project onboarding, create a source inventory and doc sync
   plan before modifying or replacing existing docs.

For a new spec, use the registry to create draft docs, then treat human review
or confirmation as the point where those docs become accepted source of truth.

For existing-project onboarding, use existing docs, code, tests, and config as
evidence; inventory them, map them to registered templates, create a sync plan,
and only then generate normalized docs.

## Lanes

### Tiny

Use for low-risk docs, copy, names, or narrow edits.

Also use for initial project setup when the work is limited to installing
declared dependencies, wiring a server entrypoint, adding a health/smoke
endpoint, or opening a local development database connection without creating
domain schema, CRUD behavior, auth, authorization, provider integration, or
data migration. A health endpoint in a new benchmark or scaffolded project is
smoke proof, not a public contract escalation by itself.

Requirements:

- Patch directly.
- Keep affected docs current.
- Run available quick checks.
- Update the harness only if friction was found.

### Normal

Use for story-sized behavior with bounded blast radius.

Requirements:

- Create or update one story file from `docs/harness/templates/stories/story.md`.
- Link relevant product docs.
- Add or update validation expectations.
- Implement the smallest vertical slice when implementation exists.
- Record or update proof status with `scripts/bin/harness-cli story add` and
  `scripts/bin/harness-cli story update`.

### High-Risk

Use when the work can affect security, data, scope, contracts, or multiple
roles/platforms.

Requirements:

- Create a story folder using `docs/harness/templates/stories/high-risk/`.
- Fill in `execplan.md`, `overview.md`, `design.md`, and `validation.md`.
- Ask for human confirmation before implementation if direction is ambiguous.
- Record a durable decision when behavior, architecture, authorization, data
  ownership, API shape, or validation requirements change meaningfully. Use a
  `docs/decisions/NNNN-*.md` file from `docs/harness/templates/decisions/decision.md`, then add
  or refresh the durable row with `scripts/bin/harness-cli decision add`.
  Decision text in a trace is not a durable decision record.

## Risk Checklist

Mark one flag for each item that applies:

| Risk flag | Applies when the work touches |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | login, logout, sessions, JWT, password, refresh token |
| Authorization | roles, permissions, tenant or company scope |
| Data model | schema, migrations, uniqueness, deletion, retention |
| Audit/security | audit logs, privacy, sensitive data, access logs |
| External systems | email, payments, cloud services, provider SDKs, queues, webhooks |
| Public contracts | API shape, response envelope, client-visible behavior |
| Cross-platform | desktop/mobile/browser split, native shell behavior, deep links |
| Existing behavior | already implemented or test-covered behavior changes |
| Weak proof | unclear or missing tests around the affected area |
| Multi-domain | more than one product domain changes at once |

## Classification

```text
0-1 flags:
  tiny or normal, based on code impact

2-3 flags:
  normal with stronger validation

4+ flags:
  high-risk

Any hard gate:
  high-risk unless the human explicitly narrows scope
```

Hard gates:

- Auth.
- Authorization.
- Data loss or migration.
- Audit/security.
- External provider behavior.
- Removing or weakening validation requirements.

## Output

At the end of intake, the agent should be able to say:

```text
Lane: normal
Reason: touches authorization, API contract, and audit behavior.
Docs: permissions, account-settings, audit-log.
Story: docs/stories/epics/E02-access-control/US-014-manager-updates-role.md.
Validation: unit, integration, E2E.
```
