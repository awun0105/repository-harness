# Template Registry

This registry tells humans and agents which templates to use when creating,
normalizing, or syncing Project Harness documentation.

## Rules

- Read this registry before creating, normalizing, or syncing project docs.
- Do not invent a new documentation format when a registered template exists.
- Do not create placeholder product domains just to fill the folder structure.
- Treat existing docs as source material until they are audited and reconciled.
- During existing-project onboarding, create a doc sync plan before replacing
  or rewriting existing project docs.
- Mark assumptions, conflicts, and unknowns explicitly.
- Use `docs/harness/templates/manifest.yml` for machine-readable template
  metadata and future CLI scaffold commands.

## Existing Project Sync

When a repository already has docs, agents must use this sequence:

1. Create a source inventory.
2. Map existing docs to registered templates.
3. Create a doc sync plan.
4. Generate normalized docs only from cited evidence.
5. Preserve conflicts and unknowns instead of guessing.
6. Ask for human review before replacing or archiving existing docs.

## New Project Docs

For a new project spec, agents may create draft docs directly from registered
templates, but the drafts are not accepted source of truth until reviewed or
confirmed by the human.
